Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events.
 I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.

Mounting – Birth of your component
Update – Growth of your component
Unmount – Death of your component


Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Mounting:

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

render:

The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.

componentDidMount


The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.

componentWillMount:

componentWillMount is executed before rendering, on both the server and the client side. 
componentDidMount is executed after the first render only on the client side.
 This is where AJAX requests and DOM or state updates should occur. ... componentWillUpdate is called just before rendering.
